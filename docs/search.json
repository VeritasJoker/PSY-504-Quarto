    "text": "Assignment requirements:\n\nIf you are using Github (recommended), make sure to commit and push your work to GitHub regularly, at least after each exercise. Write short and informative commit messages, and share the link to your assignment with me. If not, you can also send me the rmd & rendered file via Canvas.\nIn this assignment, you will not need to code from scratch. Rather, you’ll need to fill in code where needed. This assignment has a logisitic regression implementation for a scenario from EDA down to model comparison (and would be useful for whenever you may encounter such a situation in the future).\nI want the assignments to begin reflecting a bit more of how you’d be doing things on your own, where you have some prior knowledge and you figure other things out (by referring to documentation, etc.) . In addition to the rmd, I also want you to submit to me notes of anything new that you learn while finishing the assignment. And any pain-points, and we’ll discuss more.\n\nNote:\n\nIf you are fitting a model, display the model output in a neatly formatted table. (The gt tidy and kable functions can help!). Modelsummary also looks good(https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/articles/modelsummary.html)\nMake sure that your plots are clearly labeled – for all axes, titles, etc."

In addition to collecting demographic information, the survey includes questions used to gauge attitudes about government spending priorities, confidence in institutions, lifestyle, and many other topics. A full description of the survey may be found here.\nThe data for this lab are from the 2016 General Social Survey. The original data set contains 2867 observations and 935 variables. We will use and abbreviated data set that includes the following variables:\nnatmass: Respondent’s answer to the following prompt:\n“We are faced with many problems in this country, none of which can be solved easily or inexpensively. I’m going to name some of these problems, and for each one I’d like you to tell me whether you think we’re spending too much money on it, too little money, or about the right amount…are we spending too much, too little, or about the right amount on mass transportation?”\nage: Age in years.\nsex: Sex recorded as male or female\nsei10: Socioeconomic index from 0 to 100\nregion: Region where interview took place\npolviews: Respondent’s answer to the following prompt:\n“We hear a lot of talk these days about liberals and conservatives. I’m going to show you a seven-point scale on which the political views that people might hold are arranged from extremely liberal - point 1 - to extremely conservative - point 7. Where would you place yourself on this scale?”\nThe data are in gss2016.csv in the data folder."

We will just use the default priors for this. The exercise is to run this code and note your observations. What are salient differences you observe in how the model fitting takes place. With respect to the results, how do you compare the results of the model you fit with clm and the one you fit with brms?\n\n\n\nCode\n  ols2_brm = brm(Technical_Rank ~  Gender*Age, data=gb, family = cumulative, cores = 4,chains = 4)\n\n\nThe `brm` package uses a bayesian approach, estimates parameters using Markov Chain Mote Carlo (MCMC), while the `clm` package uses a frequentist approach, estimates parameters via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). `clm` is much faster and deterministic, while `brms` is slower and stochastic.\n\nThe results from `brms` provide posterior distributions with credible intervals, which tend to be wider than the standard errors in `clm`, reflecting greater uncertainty. While the point estimates from both models are similar, the bayesian approach allows for probabilistic statements about the parameters. The posterior distributions directly tell you the probability of a parameter being within a given range. Thus, I would say `brms` is more flexible and interpretable, while `clm` is computationally efficient and useful for quick estimation.\n\nThe conditional_effects function is used to plot predicted probabilities by Gender and Age across each rank.\n\n\nCode\nconditional_effects(ols2_brm, categorical = T)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis makes sense. Higher probabilities for higher Technical_Rank for females and younger ages.\ncheck_predictions from the easystats performance package is used for examining model fit (i.e., does the data fit the model being used?). Run the below code. What do you think?\n\n\n\nCode\ncheck_predictions(ols2_brm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI would say it fits the data pretty well. The observed data is within the model-predicted data intervals."

We can use our full model to predict the dependent variable, and then take the mean of the exponential, which is 9.880, while the mean wwwhr for the whole dataset is 9.793.\nOverall, a negative-binomial regression model is a good fit to the data due to dispersion.

    "text": "Today’s lab uses data from a study conducted by Coyne et al. (2019), which examined the impact of a high-quality, evidence-based vocabulary instruction intervention in kindergarten. The data consists of 1,428 students who were nested in 233 clusters or classrooms (clu_id).\nIn the sample of at-risk youth in the classroom (N = 6), half were allocated to treatment and the other half to control. The treatment group received supplemental small-group vocabulary instruction in addition to the whole-group instruction, while the control group received only whole-group vocabulary instruction. Since the observations were not independent (due to students being nested within classrooms), the researchers needed to account for this in their analysis.\nThe main question that the researchers aimed to answer was whether the supplemental small-group kindergarten vocabulary instruction intervention increased students’ knowledge of the vocabulary words taught in the intervention. To measure vocabulary knowledge, the researchers used an ETW (ETW_SpringK) assessment, which evaluated students’ ability to explain the meaning of a given word. The assessment was administered after the intervention concluded, in the spring of kindergarten. In the sample, ETW scores ranged from 0 to 52 (the maximum score), with a mean of 13.65 and a standard deviation of 11.10. To answer the research question, the researchers used two fixed effects and their interaction: TRT (1 = treatment and 0 = control) and PPVT (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, which measures students’ vocabulary before the intervention; PPVT_FallK).\nCoyne, M.

Deviation code (0.5, -0.5), aka effect code for the treatment variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNOTE: Deviation/Effect coding is one way to recode categorical variables for regression analysis. They transform the treatment variable (TRT) from: treatment → 0.5 control → -0.5\nRemember that different ways of coding categorical variables do not actually influence the results/ predictions. But they can influence how we interpret coefficients.\nNow, with deviation coding (-0.5,0.5), here: Intercept = grand mean across all groups Treatment coefficient = difference between groups (divided by 2)\nWith dummy coding (0/1), it’d be: Intercept = mean of reference group Treatment coefficient = difference from reference group\nThe key advantage? When interpreting interactions, deviation coding makes results more intuitive since coefficients show deviations from overall means (or overall main effect) rather than from a reference group (which may not always be clear or relevant, making interpretation harder) .\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#deviation code the TRT var\ndata &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  mutate(TRT = ifelse(TRT == 1, 0.5, -0.5))\n\n# Note, one can also use contr.sum to instantiate such codings. \n# Contr.sum defaults to -1/1 coding (not 0,1).\ndata$TRT &lt;- factor(data$TRT)\ncontrasts(data$TRT) &lt;- contr.sum(2)/2"

So such a likelihood ratio test will require models to be re-fit with REML=TRUE, just to give better model comparison results. )\n\n\nAnswer: - The interaction model is statistically superior to the main effects model, as indicated by lower AIC and BIC scores. This is further confirmed by a statistically significant likelihood ratio test (\\(\\chi^2 = 8.39, p = .0038\\)). This suggests that including the interaction between TRT and PPVT_FallK provides a better fit to the data.\nQ10. Use the best model from above and fit a model that adds random slopes for TRT\nAnswer:\n\n\nCode\nbest_model &lt;- lmer(ETW_SpringK ~ TRT * PPVT_FallK + (1+ TRT|clu_id), data = data)\n\n\nNext, let’s create a model with a random slope for treatment and PPVT scores. This will be our maximal model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWe could include a random slope for the interaction between the two, but we only have 6 students per classroom and makes our model too complex.\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncomplex_model &lt;- lmer(ETW_SpringK ~ TRT * PPVT_FallK + (1 + TRT + PPVT_FallK|clu_id), data = data)\n\n\nboundary (singular) fit: see help('isSingular')\n\n\n\nisSingular(complex_model)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nTake a look at the maximal model output. What is the warning message? We observe that the more complex model has a singular fit, which likely results from overfitting the data. In particular, the more complex model contains random slopes for both TRT and PPVT_FallK within clusters (clu_id). We can infer that there is not enough variation in TRT or PPVT_FallK within clusters, so the model may not be able to estimate random effects reliably. To get rid of this warning, we could reduce complexity in the model by removing some of the random slopes."

How do you interpet the modeling results, in terms of varaince in intercept, treatment effect, and residuals?\nAnswers: - The variance is 25.01 for the intercepts across the different classrooms (clu_id). This suggests there is substantial variability in the baseline ETW_SpringK scores that can be attributed to differences between classrooms before considering TRT or PPVT_FallK scores.\n\nThe variance associated with the treatment effect (TRT) across classrooms is 45.51. This suggests significant variability in how the treatment effect on ETW_SpringK scores differs from one classroom to another.\nThe variance of residuals is 57.02. This indicates the remaining within-classroom variance in student scores that cannot be explained by the model’s fixed effects or the classroom-level random effects.\nOverall, our variance components are significant for both the random intercept and slope for TRT. This suggests that multilevel modeling is, indeed, appropriate and necessary to account for the clustering of student scores within classrooms and the variability in treatment effects across classrooms."

    "text": "Reporting Results\nQ14. Briefly highlight what you think needs to be present in the results. I will share what a complete report would like in the solution.\nWrite-up the results of your MLM model incorporating the above information. This write-up should resemble what you would find in a published paper. You can use the textbook for guidance and the report function from easystats\nThe present study investigated the impact of a vocabulary instruction intervention on students’ knowledge, using a nested data structure with two levels: students (Level 1) nested within classrooms (Level 2). The analysis included 1,427 students distributed across 222 classrooms. Classrooms varied in size, with an average of approximately 6.4 students per classroom (\\(SD = 2.2, range = [2, 18]\\)).\nThe relationship between the intervention and vocabulary knowledge was modeled using a multilevel linear model, represented by the following equation:\n\n\nCode\nequatiomatic::extract_eq(best_model)\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n  \\operatorname{ETW\\_SpringK}_{i}  &\\sim N \\left(\\mu, \\sigma^2 \\right) \\\\\n    \\mu &=\\alpha_{j[i]} + \\beta_{1j[i]}(\\operatorname{TRT}_{\\operatorname{1}}) + \\beta_{2}(\\operatorname{PPVT\\_FallK}) + \\beta_{3}(\\operatorname{PPVT\\_FallK} \\times \\operatorname{TRT}_{\\operatorname{1}}) \\\\    \n\\left(\n  \\begin{array}{c}\n    \\begin{aligned}\n      &\\alpha_{j} \\\\\n      &\\beta_{1j}\n    \\end{aligned}\n  \\end{array}\n\\right)\n  &\\sim N \\left(\n\\left(\n  \\begin{array}{c}\n    \\begin{aligned}\n      &\\mu_{\\alpha_{j}} \\\\\n      &\\mu_{\\beta_{1j}}\n    \\end{aligned}\n  \\end{array}\n\\right)\n,\n\\left(\n  \\begin{array}{cc}\n     \\sigma^2_{\\alpha_{j}} & \\rho_{\\alpha_{j}\\beta_{1j}} \\\\\n     \\rho_{\\beta_{1j}\\alpha_{j}} & \\sigma^2_{\\beta_{1j}}\n  \\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\right)\n    \\text{, for clu\\_id j = 1,} \\dots \\text{,J}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(ETW\\_SpringK\\) is the student’s score on the vocabulary knowledge assessment, \\(TRT\\) is the treatment condition, \\(PPVT\\_FallK\\) is the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test score, and \\((1 + TRT|clu\\_id)\\) represents the random intercepts and slopes for treatment across classrooms. Note that \\(ETW\\_SpringK\\), \\(TRT\\), and \\(PPVT\\_FallK\\) are all Level 1 variables, and \\(clu\\_id\\) is at Level 2. For the above analysis, we mean centered \\(PPVT\\_FallK\\) within each cluster and deviation coded \\(TRT\\).\nBefore settling on the above model, we estimated an unconditional means (null) model and maximal model, which included a random slope for both treatment and PPVT scores. We compared the above model (\\(df = 8\\)) to the maximal model (\\(df = 11\\)) using a likelihood ratio test from the easystats package (version 0.6.0). We found that the more complex model did not significantly improve model fit (\\(\\chi^2 = 4.85, p = 0.185\\)). We therefore proceeded to use the simpler model for our analyses, as there was not sufficient evidence to justify additional complexity in our model.\nWe checked our model assumptions (linearity, normality of residuals, homoscedasticity, collinearity) visually, using diagnostic plots from the performance package (version 0.10.5). Based on this visual assessment, we found that all our model assumptions were satisfied. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for the outcome variable was calculated as 0.16, suggesting that 16% of the variance in vocabulary knowledge scores could be attributed to differences between classrooms. The models were estimated using Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) to account for the nested data structure. The lme4 package (version 1.1.34) was used for fitting the model, with the interactions package (version 1.1.5) for estimating and plotting interactions.\nThe fixed effects analysis revealed a significant intercept (\\(b = 13.47, SE = 0.40, t(209) = 34.03, p &lt; .001\\)), indicating a high baseline level of vocabulary knowledge. The treatment effect was also significant (\\(b = 10.47, SE = 0.62, t(213) = 17.02, p &lt; .001\\)), suggesting that the treatment had a substantial positive impact on vocabulary knowledge. Additionally, PPVT scores were positively associated with ETW scores (\\(b = 0.43, SE = 0.04, t(1091) = 9.67, p &lt; .001\\)), indicating that higher initial vocabulary levels were associated with higher post-intervention vocabulary knowledge. The interaction between treatment and PPVT scores was also significant (\\(b = 0.28, SE = 0.09, t(1074) = 3.06, p = .002\\)), suggesting that the treatment effect varied as a function of initial vocabulary levels.\nRegarding random effects, we observe a variance of 25.01 (\\(SD = 5.00\\)) for the intercepts across the different classrooms. This suggests there is substantial variability in the baseline ETW scores that can be attributed to differences between classrooms before considering treatment or PPVT scores. The variance associated with the treatment effect (\\(SD = 6.75\\)). This suggests significant variability in how the treatment effect on ETW scores differs from across clasrooms. Finally, the variance of residuals was 57.02 (\\(SD = 7.55\\)), indicating within-classroom variance in student scores that cannot be explained by the model’s fixed effects or the classroom-level random effects. Overall, our variance components are significant for both the random intercept and slope for treatment. This suggests that multilevel modeling is, indeed, appropriate and necessary to account for the clustering of student scores within classrooms and the variability in treatment effects across classrooms.\nthe model estimated the standard deviation of the random intercepts for classrooms (\\(SD = 5.00\\)), indicating variability in baseline ETW scores across classrooms. The correlation between the random intercepts and slopes for treatment within classrooms was estimated to be 0.89, suggesting a strong positive relationship between the classroom baseline scores and the treatment effect. The standard deviation of the random slopes for treatment (\\(SD = 6.75\\)) indicated substantial variability in the treatment effect across classrooms. The residual standard deviation (\\(SD = 7.55\\)) reflected the within-classroom variability in ETW scores that was not explained by the model’s fixed and random effects.\nTaken together, these results suggest that both the treatment and initial PPVT scores are significant predictors of students’ vocabulary knowledge. There was a notable interaction effect, suggesting that the benefit of the treatment varies depending on students’ initial vocabulary levels. The significant random effects for treatment across classrooms underscore the intervention’s differential effectiveness depending on classroom context. These findings highlight the importance of considering both the individual and contextual factors in educational interventions. ```"
