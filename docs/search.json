    "text": "Assignment requirements:\n\nIf you are using Github (recommended), make sure to commit and push your work to GitHub regularly, at least after each exercise. Write short and informative commit messages, and share the link to your assignment with me. If not, you can also send me the rmd & rendered file via Canvas.\nIn this assignment, you will not need to code from scratch. Rather, you‚Äôll need to fill in code where needed. This assignment has a logisitic regression implementation for a scenario from EDA down to model comparison (and would be useful for whenever you may encounter such a situation in the future).\nI want the assignments to begin reflecting a bit more of how you‚Äôd be doing things on your own, where you have some prior knowledge and you figure other things out (by referring to documentation, etc.) . In addition to the rmd, I also want you to submit to me notes of anything new that you learn while finishing the assignment. And any pain-points, and we‚Äôll discuss more.\n\nNote:\n\nIf you are fitting a model, display the model output in a neatly formatted table. (The gt tidy and kable functions can help!). Modelsummary also looks good(https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/articles/modelsummary.html)\nMake sure that your plots are clearly labeled ‚Äì for all axes, titles, etc."

Age: For every one year increase in age, the odds of being in a higher Technical_Rank category decreases by approximately 0.37%, controlling for Gender and the interaction between Gender and Age. Gender and Age: For each additional year increase in Age, the odds of being in a higher Technical_Rank category decreases by about 2.71% more for Females than for Males, controlling for Gender and Age.\nTest if the interaction is warranted\n\n#Hint: You need to create two models with clm(); one with interaction and one without. #Then you compare them using the anova test using anova()\n\n\nCode\n    anova_test &lt;- anova(model1, model2)\n    anova_test\n\n\nLikelihood ratio tests of cumulative link models:\n \n       formula:                                         link: threshold:\nmodel1 Technical_Rank ~ 1 + Gender + Age                logit flexible  \nmodel2 Technical_Rank ~ 1 + Gender + Age + Gender * Age logit flexible  \n\n       no.par    AIC  logLik LR.stat df Pr(&gt;Chisq)  \nmodel1      4 685.72 -338.86                        \nmodel2      5 683.28 -336.64   4.437  1    0.03517 *\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nYes, the interaction is warranted.\n\nUse ggemmeans to create a figure showing the interaction between Gender and Age as a function of rank.

We will just use the default priors for this. The exercise is to run this code and note your observations. What are salient differences you observe in how the model fitting takes place. With respect to the results, how do you compare the results of the model you fit with clm and the one you fit with brms?\n\n\n\nCode\n  ols2_brm = brm(Technical_Rank ~  Gender*Age, data=gb, family = cumulative, cores = 4,chains = 4)\n\n\nThe `brm` package uses a bayesian approach, estimates parameters using Markov Chain Mote Carlo (MCMC), while the `clm` package uses a frequentist approach, estimates parameters via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). `clm` is much faster and deterministic, while `brms` is slower and stochastic.\nThe results from `brms` provide posterior distributions with credible intervals, which tend to be wider than the standard errors in `clm`, reflecting greater uncertainty. While the point estimates from both models are similar, the bayesian approach allows for probabilistic statements about the parameters. The posterior distributions directly tell you the probability of a parameter being within a given range. Thus, I would say `brms` is more flexible and interpretable, while `clm` is computationally efficient and useful for quick estimation.\n\nThe conditional_effects function is used to plot predicted probabilities by Gender and Age across each rank.\n\n\nCode\nconditional_effects(ols2_brm, categorical = T)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis makes sense. Higher probabilities for higher Technical_Rank for females and younger ages.\ncheck_predictions from the easystats performance package is used for examining model fit (i.e., does the data fit the model being used?). Run the below code. What do you think?\n\n\n\nCode\ncheck_predictions(ols2_brm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI would say it fits the data pretty well. The observed data is within the model-predicted data intervals."
