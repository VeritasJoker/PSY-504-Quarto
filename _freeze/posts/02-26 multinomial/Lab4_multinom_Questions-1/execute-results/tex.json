You can read more about the survey design and respondents in the README of the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/non-voters) for the data.\n\nRespondents were asked a variety of questions about their political beliefs, thoughts on multiple issues, and voting behavior. We will focus on using the demographic variables and someone's party identification to understand whether a person is a probable voter.\n\nThe variables we'll focus on were (definitions from the codebook in data set GitHub repo):\n\n-   `ppage`: Age of respondent\n\n-   `educ`: Highest educational attainment category.\\\n\n-   `race`: Race of respondent, census categories. Note: all categories except Hispanic were non-Hispanic.\n\n-   `gender`: Gender of respondent\n\n-   `income_cat`: Household income category of respondent\n\n-   `Q30`: Response to the question \"Generally speaking, do you think of yourself as a...\"\n\n    -   1: Republican\n    -   2: Democrat\n    -   3: Independent\n    -   4: Another party, please specify\n    -   5: No preference\n    -   -1: No response\n\n-   `voter_category`: past voting behavior:\n\n    -   **always**: respondent voted in all or all-but-one of the elections they were eligible in\n    -   **sporadic**: respondent voted in at least two, but fewer than all-but-one of the elections they were eligible in\n    -   **rarely/never**: respondent voted in 0 or 1 of the elections they were eligible in\n\nYou can read in the data directly from the GitHub repo:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(nnet)\nlibrary(car)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(emmeans)\nlibrary(ggeffects)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(parameters)\nlibrary(easystats)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvoter_data <- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/non-voters/nonvoters_data.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# Lab\n\n-   The variable `Q30` contains the respondent's political party identification.

For each variable, try to replicate the visualizations and interpret the plot to describe its relationship with voter category.
